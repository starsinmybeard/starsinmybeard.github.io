      <h1>Hi! I'm Nick.</h1>
      <p> I'm currently finishing up a Full Stack Software Engineering bootcamp
        at Tech Elevator. I've learned Java, Sql, Javascript, CSS, and Html, as well as a handful of other tools, and I'm building this site 
        to practice coding and display personal projects.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h1 id="section2">So, who am I?</h1>
      <p id="p2">After graduating from Baylor University, I moved out to Los Angeles where I worked
        in the TV industry for 5 years. 
        Although working for NBC's Unscripted Post-Production team was a thrilling job, I became
        burnt out from the extremely long hours and 6 day work weeks. 
        <br>
        I felt that I could use my creativity in a new, more fulfilling manner, and that's when 
        I started to teach myself to code!
      </p>

      <h1 id="h3">So, who are YOU?</h1>
      <p>If you are an employer and found your way here from my resume, application, or linkd-in, 
        then a thanks to you for checking out my page. I'd love to chat more. My <a href="#phone">phone number</a> and
         <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=wyethworley@gmail.com" target="newTab">email address</a> are at the bottom of this page. 
      </p>
      <p>If your a friend, then I say hello. If you are an enemy, I bid you good day. And if you are my mother, tell Santa I have been good this year and 
        want some new knitting needles for Christmas.</p>
